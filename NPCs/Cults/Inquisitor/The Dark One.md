Lich who was killed by the [[disgracers]] (maybe?)
The dark one is a being who's soul is split between the undead lich (50%), his old eye (25%), and his old hand (25%).

At least 4 books about him exist, found 2 so far 

Book 1 of 4 part 1 of 2 - Found by [[Certiorari of De Novo]] in [[Session 4]]
Tells us that people don't talk about him and that he is an old dead necromancer.

Book 1 of 4 part 2 of 2 - Was at least once in the possession of [[Inquisitor of the Sword]], learned in [[Session 21]] Found in [[Session 22]] by going into the [[Inquisitor of the Sword]]'s pocket dimension.
The dark one split their soul into many parts before dying. Half of the soul found it's way into an undead beholder. Smaller parts went into the dark ones eye and hand.

Book 2 of 4 - Found by [[Certiorari of De Novo]] in [[Session 12]]
The book speaks of a way to revive him and a way to stop it. 
If the hand and eye of the dark one reunite they can be revied, however if the sword that killed them touches on of those items it will destroy it making it impossible to complete the ritual.
Cover is navy blue with a hand and an eye on the front
