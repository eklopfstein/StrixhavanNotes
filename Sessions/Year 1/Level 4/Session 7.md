It is 7 pm EST and I am the only one in voice. No one else is worthy.
[[Tribe]] has joined within the minute, she is partly worthy.
Everyone else joined within 5 minutes, they can live... for now.

## End Of Demon Fight
[[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] comes out of nowhere after the fight because they are useless.

Tasha notices that [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] came very close to dying. It is her fault for not being there and we all know it. Tasha asks for what happened in her absence and also meets [[Aster]]. Tasha gives apology chocolate. 
We discuss how the school really only exist to put bodies in the way of the [[Snarl]]. We then go back to the [[Dorms]] for the night.

## Next Morning
We wake the next morning and meet in the [[Cafeteria]] as always. We go to classes.

### Classes 
[[Magical Combat & Defense]] and [[Protective magic (warding)]]
everyone except [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] and [[Adrian]] are in this class group, both classes are running together. 
[[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] and [[Vela Callisto|Vela]] are practicing defense, [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] and [[Aster]] are practicing offense. 
Offense learned fireball and defense learned counter spell.

[[Dimensional manipulation]] 
[[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] and [[Adrian]] learned misty step.

### Research
After class we meet up in the [[Biblioplex]] and try to find any information on why the [[Mask guys]] would want to topple the [[New Gods]]. We don't find anything in the books so [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] ask the robot guide about the religion leadership on campus. [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] goes to talk to the bishops. [[Vela Callisto|Vela]] looks into the [[Snarl]] and [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] asks the librarian about books about the [[The Nine]]. The librarian knows nothing. Vela finds plenty of books on the [[Snarl]] and gets a good understanding of it's power.

[[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] took over 20 minutes to get to the [[Biblioplex]], starting to think she intentionally missed the shadow demon yesterday. She joins Vela in her reading.

[[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] approaches the secretary of the bishops. They ask about the history of the [[New Gods]] the secretary and them go back and forth pondering the history of them and the possibility that many gods, like [[Endevorous]], have been tossed aside over time and now possibly a large sum of [[The Nine]] are plotting together. After being forced to question their beliefs the secretary agrees to ponder their questions more and take a list of questions Legion has for the Bishops. [[Questions for bishops]]

## The Church Again
While walking back to the [[Biblioplex]] the random [[Voice]] talks to Legion, the voice tells them that [[Inquisitor of the Sword and Co]] use the church they saw them in in [[Session 2]] as a base of operations. Legions lectures them on using proxy sites for meetings to avoid exposing their base of operations in the event of a leaked meeting. [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] uses see invisibility to see 6 humanoids hidden in the church plus we all see an elderly nun cleaning. We establish a signal of "banana" for Kat to use in the event that the goons move to attack or trap us.

[[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] makes a joke about having 6 invisible people to keep you company when the nun says it is lonely in there and that caused the nun to stand up straight and start talking normally. The nun is definitely the [[Inquisitor of the Sword]]. She refuses to answer questions about herself or her mission but does reveal that she knows a decent amount about the [[The Nine|Old Gods]]. Claims that there are 9 of them. [[Aster]] reads the mind of one of the invisible guys and he is just thinking about slamming the door shut and his deep thoughts are wishing his mother is dead. We get them to leave the door open as we walk in.
