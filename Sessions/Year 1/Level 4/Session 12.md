Kat and Vela have become one
[[Tribe]] is trying to curse out children other than Jordan
## Prepare For [[Ruins]]
We want to study the ruins and have as much knowledge as possible. We ask one of the tour bots about who has knowledge on them. All records are kept in the dean's library for [[Lorehold]]. The robot directs us to [[Dean Ulag]], [[Dean Ulag|Dean of Chaos]], to ask for permission to access their library. 
The roads go back and forth from being chaotic and orderly. 
We reach a  tower at a crossroad. one side has very nice and clean looks, the other side is dirty and poor looking. [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] asks if they can just walk into the tower, the robot says they can try. Legion decides to knock on the door. An attendant answers the door and Legion has [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] do the talking. The attendant says the library is for house members only. [[Vela Callisto|Vela]] says they are going to be a member next year, the attendant goes back in to see what they can do. It takes ten minutes and tells us [[Dean Ulag]] says he will speak with us personally if we answer his 3 riddles.

## Dean of Chaos
1. "The shorter I am, the bigger I am. What am I?" Temper
2. "You cannot enter this room" Mushroom
3. "What has 6 legs but walks only on 4?" person on a horse
Extra riddle for a bag of gold.
1. "What has a golden head and tail but no body" gold coin
[[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] quite rudely got that on in like a second. The bag of gold is a bag made of gold infused threads. We walk up 50 flights of stairs to talk to the dean. Reaching the top we see the doors for each dean. The chaos one looks hot and loud, order looks cool and calm. We knock on the chaos door and he tries to sound threatening. He also does not know many words. Tasha talks with very basic words and gets let in, [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] tries to mimic Tasha's method. The work together to get him to let us all in.
Tasha takes the lead on trying to get us let in the library. A lot of dumb talking went back and forth. It was not hard to be let in. No stupid people allowed in. The library is from floor 27 to 47 with an entrance on 47 and 27.
[[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] finds a book on the [[The Dark One]]. This book is part 2 of 4. The book they found in [[Session 4]] is book 1 part 1
The book speaks of a way to revive him and a way to stop it. If the hand and eye of the dark one reunite they can be revied, however if the sword that killed them touches on of those items it will destroy it making it impossible to complete.
[[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] and [[Vela Callisto|Vela]] find some basic info on the ruin grinder. 
It is an field entry from last year. The person who wrote this actually failed to find anything because some unseen entity destroyed the ruin grinder that they were following. Vicious claws and a tail came out of the ground and did it. They left right after it happened.
We all look again. [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] and [[Vanitas Tatrasiel|Vanitas]] find a journal. 
We found a journal of a victim of a cave-in who was separated from her group. She ended up lasting a little over a month eating mushrooms and avoiding traps. Eventually died of malnutrition. Used blood magic to leave a part of her magical energy on a stone attached to the journal. Stone is a spell gem with the spell cone of cold on it.
Legion, Vanitas, and Kat jump of the edge and use feather fall to avoid taking damage. Tasha and Vela walk down the stairs because they are lame.

## Walking to the dorms
We talk about what we found and [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] ends up keeping the gem stone due to being the only one who can use it.
We talk about the groups and Legion mentions talking to the [[Voice]] and that triggers the voice talking to Legion. They discuss the groups and their goals and reasons. The voice is not willing to say anything about itself but does confirm some info. [[Teacher's Council]] is the final group, [[Teacher's Anti-Cult Cult]]. [[Mask guys]] and being tricked into helping the old gods who want to bring back their old order. What that is exactly is unknown but probably not good. We discuss who the voice might be but the voice doesn't help. Guess so far are, the [[Snarl]], [[Oracle]], and [[Odic]].

We get back to the dorms and go to talk to [[Vanessa Goldenmare]] about joining the ruins trip. In their room we see a note saying they are in a bath and they will join us in the ruins. [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] leaves a heating pad for her. Voice in the sky says Vanessa is going to kill Kat for that.

We establish tomorrows agenda.
Go see what supplies we are given and get extra supplies. Go to class. Find [[Grayson]].
