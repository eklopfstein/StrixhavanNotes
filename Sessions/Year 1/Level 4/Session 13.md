No session next week
"Avocados caused 9/11" Ren
"Chicago is known as The White City" Ren "Because of the snow right? Right!!?" Bilge
## Morning
[[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] sends their raven out to look for [[Grayson]] as everyone goes to breakfast. Legion makes some tea that is very dark blue and taste a little bit like blueberry. We all head out to [[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]]'s office to ask about what supplies we will be given. 
[[Ubbe Blackshield|Blackshield]] is there, he will be joining us for the trip into the [[Ruins]]. Another failing idiot who probably listens to Weezer. Good meat shield though. 
Huffdinger gave us a list of the supplies they would give us. It had food and sleeping bags but no water. We all head to class and then head out to the stores.

We find one of the [[Rainbow Bookstores]], [[Rainbow Bookstores|The Brown Book]], and most people head in. Just your classic bookstore. There is a goblin working there. Legion approaches the goblin and works out a deal to work there after they return from the [[Ruins]]. 
[[Ubbe Blackshield]], [[Ubbe Blackshield|Book Eater]], eats books. #BookEating
We head to the general supplies store. [[Vela Callisto|Vela]] and [[Vanitas Tatrasiel|Vanitas]] get stuff to climb for some reason. We all also stuff like food, water, and cooking supplies.

## Find [[Grayson]]?
We decide our best option to use Locate Object to try to find his mask. [[Professor Makayla]] is our first thought for someone who has seen the masks and would be willing to help us. She does not know Locate Object. So instead [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] asks if she can ask the damned if they have seen him. A spirit said that them and someone learned something bad. They fought over it and the other killed this. We decide to head to the [[Dorms]] and see who was Grayson's roommate thinking that might be the person we heard from.

Session ends because [[Tribe]] needed to fix a dragon.
