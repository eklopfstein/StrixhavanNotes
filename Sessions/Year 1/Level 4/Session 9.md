[[Tribe]] went to the bathroom to shit out a subplot to use, had her roommate help
## Leaving The [[Cafeteria]]
As we go to leave [[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]] tells us that they expect one of the cults to crash a banquet. It is around dinner time at [[Kermit's Girls]].  Huffdinger thinks they will be able to handle them. [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] mentions how they didn't handle the terrorist on the first day. [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] also mentioned that they also didn't stop the shadow demon.
[[Professor NaN (Not a Number)]] is presenting a new invention at this event. It is to start around sun set. We debate which professor is better.

[[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] wants to find out the professors' pay.
We try to ask a guide bot for payroll info. It asked for a password and we guessed and got locked out. We discuss different ways we could vandalize... I mean unlock the tour bot. 

We give up and head to get clothes for the event. We head into [[Acient Marines]]. We pick out some outfits and [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] says that [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] will be pulling out the bitches with their outfit. We decide to head over to [[Kermit's Girls]] early to scout the place.

## [[Kermit's Girls]]
We get there and we see [[Professor NaN (Not a Number)|Not a Number]] working on his invention. [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] uses their raven to see the invention. It appears to be a small automated dragon. Legion and [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] walk around back to see if anything look sus. Nothing noticeable. There is a shady dude standing in a corner and a lady staring at Legion.

[[Vela Callisto|Vela]] looks around the place for anything else of interest, finds nothing. [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] goes to where to professor is and just listens/watches.

Legion and [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] eventually approach here. Cut to black.
