Pre session discussed why One D&D is bad while waiting for [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] for about 10 minutes
Spent a solid 10 more minutes discussing the events of last week and [[Ubbe Blackshield|Blackshield]]'s poor spending habits
## Morning of [[Ruins]] trip
We get up in the morning and have our breakfast to prepare for our trip. 
We meet up with [[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]] to go down.

[[Vanessa Goldenmare]] did come.
People here who did not sign up
Tiefling male [[Lorehold]]
Eleven girl [[Prismari]] 

They have ropes setup to allow each person to climb down. [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] offers their body as a safety in case anyone happens to fall while climbing down. 

We are warned about creatures in the ruins that would wish to kill us and they likely have seen us lower the equipment down and have likely prepared an ambush already. [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] sends their raven ahead to do a recon before the group reaches the bottom. Lower down it appears the earth was carved into brick shapes to create this ruin. We start to hear mechanic clanking and dripping water. on the ground there is our gear for the trip and a wagon that appears to be several years old for moving gear.

Legion's raven saw a "mushy humanoid" that looks like a non hardened clay golem. It starts to charge us, combat.
[[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]] pull out a Glock and pops on in the golem. The bullets floats back to the gun after hitting. 
[[Ubbe Blackshield]] and the Golem get in a dick measuring contest. Ubbe managed to lose to a dickless creature. 
We kill it and Ubbe decides to splash in the puddle. 

>"I'm going to dick wrestle with that elf" [[Ubbe Blackshield]]

## Pick a path

There are several paths, some look more built and others look more naturally formed. [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] wants to go down the second of the more natural paths. [[Vela Callisto|Vela]] agrees. Legion tries to get insight from others and sends their raven down their path of choice to see what lies ahead. Not much feedback given. The raven sees one of the spider like mage hunters that helped the [[Mask guys]] attack the school in [[Session 0]]. Legion warns the group about the spider and mentions that it works for the [[Mask guys]]. [[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]] voices fear that the group is down here but Legion manages to say that they were unaware of their presence down here despite them being down here is one of the reason they are here. [[Grayson]] chimes in using magic to talk in Legion's head to warn them that the spider is very strong and made to kill magic users. Legion gets feedback from Grayson and they decide the best way to get to the [[Mask guys]] leader is to follow that path but stay out of the vision of the mage hunter.

After a bit of thinking [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] tries to talk to [[Grayson]] again but only gets a response from the [[Voice]]. They try to gaslight the voice into thinking they are not in power of the hivemind they belong to. This fails but the voice still seems to harbor some doubt in their control. After legion gives more reason for the voice to doubt their control the voice ends up getting mad and leaving. They are on the ropes! In the end the voice says the spider can likely see the raven and odds of stopping it from attacking the raven are low. So Legion will need to be careful to follow it without getting the group captured.
