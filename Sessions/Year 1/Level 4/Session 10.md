## Resuming Banquet
[[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] and [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] approach the random lady. She ignores Tasha so Legion starts asking questions. he says she is searching. She tried to charm Legion but failed and they noticed. Legion confronts her about it but she ignores it. They continue to push for information.

Legion sees [[Aster]] and asks him to read the ladies mind. He does and see that she's very hungry so Legion ask her if she wants something to eat. Aster says that she isn't that kind of hungry so Legion asks her is she wants a drink. [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] walks away and join Aster. Legion continues to annoy the lady and see suddenly disappears. 

We debate foods that do and don't exist in this world. This someone leads to talking about global politics. 

Now on the the creepy guy in the corner. [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] and [[Vela Callisto|Vela]] go to talk to them. Tasha is eating chicken feet. The closer they get to him they start to hear gears turning. The guy speaks in all languages at once, has no eyes and six hands, and is really bad at answering questions. Vela and Tasha keep asking the machine to do tasks to show if it wants food and it keeps giving both answers. [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] raven dumps another glass of water on Vela. Vela uses magic to slam the door on the raven on its way out.

## Presentation
[[Professor NaN (Not a Number)]] starts presenting his invention. He calls it a home defense system. It is a large dragon made out of clockwork gears. the dragon is able to poke it's head out the roof and breath flames out. The cloaked figure starts using a crystal and charges at a dragon. He puts the crystal in the dragon and it grabs the machine and flies. [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] and [[Vela Callisto|Vela]] misty step to the dragon. Vela falls off shortly later trying to climb around but lands on [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] for safety. Legion uses mage hand to pull out the crystal which causes a magic emp but the mage hand tosses the crystal in Legion's bag. Legion uses feather fall but the machines crash into a stadium. A janitor or two may have died in the crash but other than that the place was empty. The eyes of the dragon changed to green, same color the dolls controlled by [[Inquisitor of the Sword and Co]] had.

We go to look at the dragon and robot's remains. The machine dude had a green crystal in him, it has been broken in the fall. The dragon is broken into pieces. Legion sends their raven to spray sand in the dragon and when it does it stops moving. They decide to put sand everywhere to put it our of it's misery. Legion takes to robot dude's head as a trophy. Vela takes the parts of the robot's crystal. [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] touches a part of the crystal and suddenly sees a dark void. She sees a magic sword with an eyeball looking at her. It's name is [[Nepenthe]]. The sword offers Kat her own soul in exchange for the [[Snarl]]. Kat was able to drop the crystal into a pocket to keep it on her without it taking control of her.
