First few minutes spent talking about work and the worst language ever (Fr\*nch) 
Jordan is getting McDonald's and Kaia cannot eat fast food
[[Tribe]] got interrupted about 20 times when trying to do the recap
## Leaving The Dragon Carcass
We wait 10/15 minutes to see if [[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]] shows up after hearing the crash. He does not show up but while waiting we see a lot of teachers and bots start to show up. [[Professor Makayla|Makayla]] and [[Dean Long]] are among the people that show up. We approach Makayla to avoid looking suspicious approaching a dean. She asks about what happened here as she has meet the spirits of the janitors that died in the crash. [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] tells her about what she saw when she touched the shard of the crystal. [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] explained the crystals, as much as they know that is. Makayla recommends getting the crystal to [[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]]. We head back to the dorms with plan to give the crystal to him tomorrow.

## Next Morning
We head to [[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]]'s office first thing in the morning. [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] decides to head to [[Professor Makayla|Makayla]]'s office instead. We notice 3 students in his office. We knock on the door. The three students have signed on to our [[Ruins]] trip.

[[Elise Arlecchino]]
First student to introduce himself. Very tiny, very stepable fairy. 

[[Arthic Mordaar]]
Tall dragon dude. "not all mentally there" high 24/7. 

[[Vanitas Tatrasiel|Vanitas]]
Pale dude with white hair and dark high. Mister fancy pants attire. Emotionless (typical edgy teen).

We then introduce ourselves, [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] isn't with us at the time so [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] introduces her for them.

We discuss what happened last night and then get back to talking about the ruins. As long as we all agree we will be entering the ruins in 2 days. Schools gives "basic needs". We tell [[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]] about our plans to follow a ruin grinder to the secrets and get them before it destroys them. We start discussing the events of last night and how the crystal might help us disable the grinder before it does any damage. Huffdinger explains his experience with these crystals as he found some in the dolls from our first mission, after his studies he saw that taking the crystal out only stalls them for a few seconds. We suggest repeatedly putting the crystal on and off the grinder to keep it in the reboot time. 
[[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] hangs back to talk with Huffdinger as we head to breakfast.

### Tasha and Kat with their advisors
[[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] sees that [[Professor Makayla|Makayla]]  is currently preparing for her history class. Tasha Wanted to ask for a mentorship to learn more spells and such from her. Tasha says she is willing to learn more genre of spells than what is her norm. Makayla suggests that she signs up for a class for what she wants rather than find a mentor. Tasha prefers 1-on-1 learning of class environments. 

[[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] shows [[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]] the shard of a crystal that she got from the robot and explains what happened to him. Huffdinger asks Kat to keep the crystal on her to test whether or not Kat has free will. This is in direct violation of GCP and will be reported to the FDA. She agrees to do it and then catches up with the rest of the group.

## Breakfast Time
We go to breakfast and sit at our table. [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] makes tea with little red leaves. The tea taste like apple and makes it hard to focus for ~30 minutes after drinking it and makes us smarter for the next hour. Breakfast is stir-fried racoon flavored with nutmeg and horseradish, served with brined navy beans and au poivre cauliflower. [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] shows up and introduces herself to the new group members. We enjoy our breakfast, a few people don't drink the tea once they he the properties. [[Vela Callisto|Vela]] gives her tea to Celeste.

## [[History]] Class
On the way to history class [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] tells the new people that it is custom to touch the ceiling to ask a question. [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] tries to explain that they were just raising their hands. [[Elise Arlecchino]] starts to day dream about Kat helping with the children back where she came from, shameless plug. As we walk into the class we see [[Professor Makayla|Makayla]]  preparing some spell. The class gets to pick a person from history to summon to speak to them. [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] picks to summon [[Endevorous]]. [[Tribe]] says some word to summon him, I assume Makayla said it in their version of Latin. 

We see a ball of light form and make the shape of a phoenix and stands on the desk. Legion mentions each of the cults and tries to see where he falls, seems to have no players that he is willing to share at least. Seems very mad at the mentions of the [[The Nine|Old Gods]]. He also mentions that he was overthrown by his daughter so Legion offers a book on parenting. [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] ask what he thought his best accomplishment was and he said bringing the water levels down, Legion boos. [[Elise Arlecchino]] asks about what he might wish he could redo and he says telling him would cause him to suffer a fate worse than death. Tasha asks what his greatest fear is, somewhere in the multiverse there is a group of people stronger than [[Odic]] and then he starts to blip away. Lastly says "if they are to be freed a holy war of real gods will break out. A real one with powerful gods instead of 1 real gods and 4 imposters." as he disappears. 

Awkward silence takes over, Tasha asks if there is homework and Makayla dismisses class. 
We all go somewhere private to give the new players a briefing on the cults and what we know so far.
