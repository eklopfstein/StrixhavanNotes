Spent 10 minutes talking about the Queen of England and Irish people 
## Down Rocky Path 2
[[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] recalls their raven and asks [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] to move the light spell from the raven to a pebble it grabbed. The Raven is going to follow the mage hunter 50 feet behind and the group will follow the raven 50 feet behind it. [[Ubbe Blackshield]] and the NPCs stay another 50 feet behind with the cart. [[Grayson]] shares with us that the mage hunter has a sense for magic within 120 feet so it already knows we are here. The mage hunter starts flying and then pulses some magic energy. It puts a mark of tracking on the raven and [[Vela Callisto|Vela]] because they failed the saving throw. There's another mage hunter crawling on the roof at us. Both of the mage hunters appear to be looking for something in the area and don't mind us. We notice some old tnt barrels that seem to have been used roughly 5 years ago to break open this area. We decide to go down a different path for today and come back to this path tomorrow.
Outside this tunnel there is a man made tunnel to the left and a more natural tunnel to the right. By a 2-1 vote we decide to go down the natural looking path.

## Down Different Rocky Path
We head down the path and we still rocky pedestals that seem to once had large statues. After a while of walking we find a construct on the ground, beaten up with claw marks and lacks a power source. It is a ruin grinder. It is around the size of our cart. [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] mentions a terrible idea, we might be able to use the crystal that turns objects to the [[Object Army]]. The people who built these [[Ruins]] have been known to create pretty much everything out of bronze. As far as [[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]] knows there is no notes about things like tool sizes that people know about that show if something was built by this civilization. We decide to hook the crystal up to the grinder after [[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]] disables it. The machine starts up but it seems to be currently talking to [[Nepenthe]]. We all start talking about if objects can have souls and [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] mentions their conversation with [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]].
The machine powers up and starts speaking it's known language. [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] uses comprehend languages to understand the machine. The machine says that it was destroyed millions of years ago. When they speak common the machine panics and attempts to destroy secrets down below. It couldn't be stopped so [[Ubbe Blackshield|Blackshield]] pulls the crystal out. Legion's raven sees the mage hunters start sprinting this way.
The group starts going deeper into the ruins to hide. Once the mage hunters get to the ruin grinder they tore it apart and Legion watched from the raven. After getting the ruin grinder, the mage hunters start walk farther down the path in our direction. [[Grayson]] mentions that using the armor he can get the mage hunters to stop. We make a plan.

Grayson stays there with [[Ubbe Blackshield|Blackshield]], [[Vela Callisto|Vela]], and [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] to stop them. Everyone else goes farther down the hall to get away from where the NPCs think they will be causing a cave in. [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] and [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] talk to [[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]] about the ruin grinder's speech and how their language works. When the raven sees the mage hunters approach. Legion then uses magic to cause the sound of a distant cave in to make the NPCs think there was one. [[Grayson]] then mentions that the mage hunters are going back to camp so we should follow to get to their leader. He then jumps on the hunters to pretend to be taken. 

The group heads to where the fake cave in was done and [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] warns [[Vela Callisto|Vela]] about how they are going to lie about the cave in being magically undone by the mage hunters. They have Vela use entangle to make the walls and roof look broken up to add to the idea that it was caved in and undone. They get there and seem to pass along the lie as they walk on to "save" [[Grayson]].

[[Ubbe Blackshield|Blackshield]] has daddy issues. 

Upon getting back to the center area where the group first descended into the ruins they rest for the night to avoid overworking themselves before reaching the [[Mask guys]] base.

## Level up to level 5

Post session: [[Ubbe Blackshield|Blackshield]] considered how it would feel to be pegged by [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]]. Kat said he is not the first to want to be pegged by a pillow.
