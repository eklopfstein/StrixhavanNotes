Tribe was late to session as she was getting her chicken tenders delivery (no sauce, basically Hitler)
[[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] was watching LOTR (Also no sauce, Stalin)
## Learn About [[Grayson]]'s roommate
His roommate is/was a Tiefling named Nexus. We head to the room. [[Ubbe Blackshield|Blackshield]] is right across the hall from them. [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] gets a key for the room as no one answered our knock. We investigate the room and see that there is stuff in the closet that is nicely maintained. But the beds and such are thrown around. Kat takes the key back while Ubbe stands watch pretending to struggle with their lock. [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] finds the necklace that gives the [[Mask guys]] armor and takes it again. [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] cleans the room. Legion leaves his raven behind to alert them when Grayson returns. Ubbe uses his city secrets to help navigate us around campus twice as fast.

We all sit in the dorm common area and wait to see if [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]]'s raven spots [[Grayson]]. We deice to move to [[Ubbe Blackshield|Blackshield]]'s room. Legion goes into the eyes of their raven. A raven lands next to them. Grayson's raven. Legion tells the raven to meet them at [[Kermit's Girls]] at sundown. They dismiss their raven just before Grayson's raven cast something to kill it.

## [[Kermit's Girls]]
We spend some time here before the meeting to look less suspicious and to introduce our new players to great food and culture. 
Menu
Trail rations (1 cp)
Mystery Meatloaf (2 sp) guess the meat, meal is free
We partake in the mystery meat challenge. It tastes amazing, taste of a mix of pork, chicken, and fish.
Not human. Lizardfolk is close. Type of snake. Green scales. It was a Naga.
Kermit points out that someone is pacing in front of the building. It is [[Grayson]].
[[Ubbe Blackshield|Blackshield]] pulls a hand axe out of his chain mail and we say it's a dwarven letter opener. What we saw pacing outside the building was a projection again.

[[Vela Callisto|Vela]] joins and both [[Tribe]] and [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] just noticed. 

We walk behind [[Ubbe Blackshield|Blackshield]] as we follow the illusion, Tasha goes back in the bar to see if [[Kermit]] is an illusion or shapeshifted Grayson. He was not. 

In the alley way we are ambushed by an imp who cast a sphere of darkness. Then Grayson tries to charm all of us but Ubbe was out of the area. Ubbe hits him and makes him lose concentration. We now force [[Grayson]] to come talk to us without the spells.
Grayon says the [[The Nine|Old Gods]] are called "the nine". We share what we have learned about them and Grayson says they will join us in the ruins tomorrow. Grayson says their leader is down in the [[Ruins]] collecting info on the old gods. [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] asks when they will get their own armor and Grayson said we can talk to the leader about that. Ubbe accidentally told Grayson that [[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]] is a member of the [[Teacher's Anti-Cult Cult]] and [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] mentions [[Nepenthe]] but gives no info to keep him guessing. 

We head back to the dorms for the night as Grayson teleports away.
