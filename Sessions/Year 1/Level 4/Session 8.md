[[Tribe]] went to start session but went to get water instead
Comes back to tell fun story, it was a very odd story
## Church Meeting
[[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] and the nun start by talking about why they are so unwelcoming for a nun and [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] asks about her habits. The nun says she has met the [[The Nine|Old Gods]] and basically calls them weak.
We discuss [[Adrian]]'s racism 
The nun shows that she is in fact [[Inquisitor of the Sword]] Kat notices one of the guys are starting to close the door they promised to not close. [[Vela Callisto|Vela]] throws a weapon at the dude closing the door and hits, uses a spell on it to restrain him and fails. Starts a fight.
We try to talk our way out of the fight. We inform her of the [[Teacher's Council]] and try to convince her that we can help. [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] lies and tells well known false information. [[Inquisitor of the Sword|Inquisitor]] mentions some ruin grinder in ruins under the school. She lets us go but we are told if we return we better have good information to share.
Kat tried to say poetry and it sounds like pillow archery. We decide to talk to [[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]] about the underground [[Ruins]].

## Back to [[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]]
We arrive at his office and he was not there. We assume he is either at lunch or dead. We ask [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]]'s counselor, [[Professor Makayla]], where she might be. She just started a 4 hour lecture. We talk about how we should address her advisor.  The voices she hears in her head and telling her that we were going to come and that a great foe was killed on campus. She is talking to the shadow demon that we killed but it won't tell her anything. Tasha lies about how she knows about the [[Ruins]]. The advisor tells us about how a group of 6 or more with an adult for at least a week can venture in the [[Ruins]] below. We confirm [[Professor Makayla|Makayla]] is a member in the [[Teacher's Council]].

## Off to the [[Cafeteria]]
We go to lunch and while we are there we put a post on the board to join us in the [[Ruins]]. One of the people who got gender bent during the raid in [[Session 0]] enters and walks over the job board. We go over to cut them off before they leave. They lead us to their room to talk about that night in private. Their new name is [[Vanessa Goldenmare]].
[[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] questions her about what they were doing. It was a loyalty and skill test for new recruits. We tell her that [[Grayson]] assigned us the task of learning more about what he means by topple the [[New Gods]] and she said we could find answers in the [[Ruins]]. She tells us that the ruin grinder is a machine that destroys parts of the ruins, not sure why.
[[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]] complains that we were discussing the [[Teacher's Council]] too loudly while he was on his way to get cookies from the [[Cafeteria]]. He agrees to be our adult for the [[Ruins]]. He also tells us the ruin grinder was built as a fail safe to destroy the ruin's secrets, we can use it to lead us to the secrets and destroy it before it gets to them.
