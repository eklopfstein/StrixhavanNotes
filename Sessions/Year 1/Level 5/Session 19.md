Everyone somehow got in voice a whole 2 minutes before session start
We will be mugging [[Tribe]] at their work
## Back In the [[Ruins]]
We start to head out of the town. While going through the route of the way we were led in we start to consider looking around other routes. 
[[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] asks [[Grayson]] if he knows anything about the maze, he says he does not spend much time down here. He is mostly a field agent. We decide to take a short rest while deciding what path to go down.

Some Wraiths attack us (¬_¬). We kick ass with some AOEs and [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] deals the final blow to most.

Fight ends and we all finish our rest. Legion want to head down the path that is least traveled but [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] and [[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]] wants to just return to the school. Legion manages to convince them.

## Down Unused Path

After a while of walking the path we notice that the footprints on the path seem to suddenly turn  back. We start to walk forward and the [[Voice]] talks in [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]]'s head trying to get them to turn the group around. Legion tries to get the voice to tell them why they should turn around or a reason to turn around. The voice summons 4 elementals as the reason to turn around.

> [[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]] starts licking the rock elemental 

[[Vela Callisto|Vela]] notices some silver rope that is coming out of the backs of the elementals that disappears into nothingness. Legion was able to tell that this rope was a link to the soul of these elementals. 
[[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]] says the [[Voice]] is hiding porn behind the door. The voice sarcastically agrees. We keep pressing the Voice for information.  [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] tries to make the voice think that maybe a different thread is in that room and he isn't aware of it, didn't seem to work. He accidentally admits to being in the Astral Plane. We head out.
