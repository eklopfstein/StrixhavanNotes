## Walking Back
We plan walk back to the the entrance of the ruins. We get all the way back to the puzzle door with the as [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] resummons their raven. There is one path left from this room that they haven't been down. Legion sends their raven down it to scout it out but finds nothing after 10 minutes. The group agrees to walk down the path for an hour or so to see if there is anything.

> "We are becoming terrorist" [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]]

After about 20 minutes of walking down the path it ends with a stone chest against a wall. Legion casts Identify on the chest. The chest has a glyph of warding on it so we stand back as Legion and [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] try to open to chest with their mage hands. The glyph goes off and it's magic goes through our magic and hits us. Legion saves but Kat doesn't and Kat get cursed.

> An obese old woman appears each night to hover over the cursed as they sleep, staring at them in slack-jawed annoyance. Drool dribbles from her mouth, onto the cursedâ€™s sleeping form. If she is confronted, she flies into a rage fit that will prevent anyone from sleeping. If she is attacked, she is killed, but the dreams of the cursed are tormented and give no rest. She returns the next night, still agitated from having been slain.

There is also a bowl of some liquid in the chest. [[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]] wants to drink. [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] keeps it and casts identify on it. It is a bowl of commanding water elementals. There are carvings on the bottom of it that seemed to power down when removed from the chest. We believe it was the source of the elemental that the [[Voice]] summoned. We try to think of a good way to find the other ones and the Voice chimes in trying to get us not to do it. He mentions that there is a "main defense" behind the door. Legion and Ubbe work together to convince him to let us in and it works.

## To The Door
Approaching the door we see the elementals are all gone but the door is locked. [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] manages to get the [[Voice]] open the door by back handedly saying that she expected him to have more spells. 

There is a small circular room with an "unusual" device in the middle of the room. It's some large mechanical device. Upon walking in [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] notices nothing, [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] kind of notices this but is shielded by the crystal she has, [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] and [[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]] notice the machine is how the [[Voice]] controls people. Legion gets Ubbe to keep this info to himself for now. The group sets up to take a long rest outside the door. During the time of the rest, Legion uses their light activity studying the device.
The device looks about 3 or 4 years old. The magic on it show traces of the following spells. Dream, detect thought, message. For now, Legion keeps this info to himself but notes it in his notebook.
