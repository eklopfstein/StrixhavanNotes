## Next Morning
We sleep through the night just fine and start down the rocky path the the mage hunters took [[Grayson]]. We set up to move forward and we send the raven forward to watch for any idle mage hunters. [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] guides the raven through the halls to ensure it can follow the path the mage hunters went down. It saw an area that has water in it that almost fills the next area. Legion heads down with a pebble with light on it so they can see. Going down Legion find some ruin grinders in perfect condition. No distinct markings on them. They then move on to tapestries on the walls and read them. They describe some great conflict on lands unknown to them. They find a map of the world as this culture knew it. They also find carpet on the ground and took a piece of it with them.

Getting topside Legion works with [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] to map out the hallways they went into and draw the old world map that Legion saw. [[Ubbe Blackshield|Blackshield]] and Legion look at the carpet. Looking at it they can tell that it is a natural fabric but belongs to an animal that no longer exists or lives somewhere unknown to man. Keep going down the hall toward [[Grayson]].

The raven quickly hits a small room with a door in it that it cannot get past. While the group is catching up Legion looks around the room for traps and does not find any. Upon catching up the group reads the marking on the door.

## [[Mask guys]] Base
"a spoken word unseals me inside the lies the characters hide". [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] finds Seekers and a hole in the ceiling starts to pour water in. [[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]] says "Truth" and another hole opens. The answer was "Truth Seeker" found by Ubbe. The door opens and the water floods out. Beyond the door is two members of the [[Mask guys]] and a mage hunter. They demand that we surrender our weapons and we refuse. We start to fight and after 2 rounds we find out they are much stronger than we thought and ended up surrendering. We give them our weapons and they take us into their base. [[Vela Callisto|Vela]] is unconscious be stabilized.
