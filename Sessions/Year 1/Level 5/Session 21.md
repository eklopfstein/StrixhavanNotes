Someone was late today, not sure who. But I won in discord put put.
## Walking Back
As we discuss our plan walking back, [[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]] asks [[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]] his opinion/thoughts on what to do/say about the student who died. Huffdinger starts to get mad about our work with the cult and somewhat blames us for the death of the student. [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] calls the death of the student as an unfortunate accident. Huffdinger asks if him dying would be an unfortunate accident too. Legion says yes and that would apply to any of them. He then pulls out the gun and points it at [[Grayson]]. [[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]] and [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] manage to convince him to not shoot Grayson and instead he says they will take him hostage and the [[Teacher's Council]] will decide his fate. 

> [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] wants [[Grayson]]'s long hard precious rod, their words not mine

This triggers a whole fight where [[Grayson]] tries to turn [[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]] to stone but [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] dispels it. [[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]] tries to grapple Grayson twice, failing both times. We end up in a stand off and Legion, with [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]]'s help, was able to talk both Grayson and Huffdinger into putting their weapons away and we head back up without fighting.

## Back On The Surface
Upon coming back up we see that the office of the dean's, [[Lorehold]], on fire.  Likely related to the book [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] found in [[Dean Ulag]]'s library. 

[[Vela Callisto|Vela]] claims to enjoy [[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]]'s company. [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] says she enjoys him making her feel more intelligent. 

We see 6 cloaked people and [[Inquisitor of the Sword]] standing over [[Dean Ulag]]. They are trying to get the book from him that [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] took without him knowing. He claims to have thrown it into the fire. The group work together to distract the people and it results in the Inquisitor running away and leaving the others to deal with us. Legion one shots them and [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] rushes in to heal the dean. We manage to get Ulag to a station some teachers have set up to help anyone hurt.
