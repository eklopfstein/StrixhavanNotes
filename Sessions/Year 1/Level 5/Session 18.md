Ubbe was yelled at at work today
## Guided Tour
### Halls
[[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] decides the walk on the ceiling as the guards lead us through the halls.
While the guards lead us to speak with their leader they ask why we came looking for them.
[[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]] said for education, they did not believe it. [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] says for their cool suits and mentions that they have taken a suit twice.

> "You are an insult to the [[Prismari]] college" [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] to [[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]]

The mage hunters are half machine, half biological. Created by their leader, [[The Bishop]], to serve their order. 
### City
After about 90 minutes of walking we start to see a faint light of campfires down the path. Upon reaching them it appears to be a small city where they live. [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] asks if they live down here and they say they do "for the moment". We notice that this town only holds a few hundred people but the attack in [[Session 0]] had several thousand people. They clearly have multiple similar outposts. 

We ask questions about the group and the [[The Nine|Old Gods]].
They only have one bishop and no cardinals. Unsure how [[The Bishop]] came to power. Group is about 90 years old.

[[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] mentions they succeeded several times in recruitment tests. The guards start to protest and then [[Grayson]] chimes in and says we cannot be killed yet because we are with him. [[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]] seems heated about this new information. 

We all clean up for this meeting. [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] gets in their formal form after hearing [[Grayson]] say that meetings like this with [[The Bishop]] are rare.

## [[The Bishop]] Meeting
The bishop asks who has entered and [[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]] decides to test the echo, there is an echo. The bishop tells us to step into the light. We send Ubbe in first in case he plans on killing us. Upon getting into the light we see [[The Bishop]] is a humanoid who is wearing the [[Mask guys]] armor. We see a Tiefling tail on him. 

The [[Ruins]] were made as a final stronghold for the [[The Nine|Old Gods]] before they were jailed by the [[New Gods]]. [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] asks about the goals of the [[The Nine|Old Gods]] and the bishop says they would want to stay out of the picture. Legion questions how they would do that and prevent history from repeating, Bishop says that's the gods problem. Legion argues that the gods would make it the people's problem. 

The [[Voice]] speaks in [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]]'s mind and tells them that the bishop's name is [[The Bishop|Kilrai Shattermast]]. Legion recalls that [[The Bishop|Kilrai]] is one of the Inquisitors who helped bring the [[The Dark One]] to life the first time but betrayed them and helped the [[Disgracers]] kill him in exchange for their life. 

Legion mentions it and the bishop seems shocked by this being known. Legion informs them that the [[Inquisitor of the Sword]] is actively working to revive the dark one. [[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]] seems even more pissed as this discuss progresses. Using this info Legion gets the bishop to agree to an alliance of sorts with them and also agrees to give them a "gift as a sign of good faith". Each party member gets something. 

[[Vela Callisto|Vela]] has a Pokeball and Legion finally gets their own set of [[Mask guys]] armor to keep.

We head out after agreeing to this semi-alliance and told we can report through [[Grayson]]. We leave and Grayson stays with us as his job is now to be our middle man for speaking with [[The Bishop]]. New Grayson nickname, [[Grayson|The Messenger]].
