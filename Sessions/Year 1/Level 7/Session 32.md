Ubbe is back

## Breakfast
We talk over our possible leads we can follow.

- Go down into the [[Ruins]]
	- Would need a teacher
- Report [[Oracle]] findings to [[Grayson]]
- [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] speaks with [[Nepenthe]]
- Go after [[The Dark One]] books
	- Deadly
- Speak with religious people

Haven't picked an option but step 1 will be to report to Grayson about the Oracle and try to get some intel on what they are doing with [[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]]'s soul. Might be able to use that info to pick an option.

We talk about how we plan on getting more info on Huffdinger while [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] goes on a date with [[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]] and tries to get him to join us. Tasha swoops Ubbe off his feet and carries him off to join us in hopes of saving [[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]]. Ubbe had no clothes on so he had to get dressed before returning. While Ubbe has yet to get dressed, Tasha says that Ubbe looks good and Ubbe responds by playing with his nipples. They plan another date at the "forge" for [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] to help [[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]] work on his "handle". 

We leave the sign to Grayson in his room that we are ready to talk and go about our day.

## Report To [[Grayson]]
Grayson pulls [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] aside as they are leaving a class. Legion informs Grayson of the way the [[Oracle]] uses the [[Snarl]] from afar and Grayson says that gave him some ideas. Legion asks about if there are any teachers or such that are in the group that they could use as a supervisor to go into the [[Ruins]]. He does not know of any but will ask. 
Also asks if they have gotten any intel from [[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]]'s soul, he claims to not know if they have gotten any info from him or even if they are the ones who took him.

## Lunch
[[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]] is moping about [[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]]'s death. [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] gives him one of Huffdinger's favorite cookies to cheer him up. [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] gives the party the update on what [[Grayson]] said. [[Vela Callisto|Vela]] points out that the [[Voice]] has the most access to souls as he is in the Astral plane. [[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]] mentions how [[Professor Makayla|Makayla]] was the only one who could confirm that his soul was gone and was the first person to show up when he died, maybe she is a spy.

We make a plan to try to get more info from [[Professor Makayla]]. [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] is going to speak with  [[Professor Makayla|Makayla]] about her apprenticeship while the rest of us are "studying" to find info on Huffdinger's soul. During this, [[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]] has an "emotional outbreak" and starts throwing things to get Makayla to come out, allowing Tasha to look around her office.

## [[Professor Makayla|Makayla]]'s Investigation
We set up our act. [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] gives both [[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]] and [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] inspiration for their parts. [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] sends their little guy with Tasha up to Makayla's office.

[[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] and [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] are tapped on their feet by a tour guide bot. The bot tells them that their presences is requested in [[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]]'s office. Before leaving, Legion leaves their raven behind and says that "smash" would mean for [[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]] to cause his distraction and "shit" would mean something bad happened in Huffdinger's office.

[[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] reaches [[Professor Makayla|Makayla]]'s office, she is grading papers. Tasha speaks to them about the necromancy learning options they have available to them, she has classes set up for her next year and that she is willing to teach her a bit during the their breaks. Going upstairs to look into [[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]]'s office, Legion uses their raven to tell [[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]] to smash. All advisors come out to investigate, including Makayla. [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] uses haste to investigate the office. She finds a fake panel that hides one of the [[Mask guys]] necklace. Tasha sets to room back in place.

[[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] and [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] enter [[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]]'s old office and there is a tall skinny elf male in a nice suit. It is [[Elvian]]. He is our new guidance counselor, he was contracted by the school for his inventive ability. He job is to help protect the school and be our advisor. We are his only students. Likely has terms in his contract that are related to spying on us or something, won't share contract terms.
