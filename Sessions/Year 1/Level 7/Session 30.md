Tribe had plain ramen from a corner store for dinner
## [[Oracle]] Trip

### Day One
To prepare for the trip up the mountain we go to the store and buy some rations for the weekend.

[[Tribe]] called [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] a unintelligent wild animal.

[[Vela Callisto|Vela]] leads the way up the mountain, desperately needs help from both [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] and [[Anuva Moonbeam|Anuva]] to not get us killed.

There are some rocks following us. Legion asks if rocks have rights, told no. Casts inflict wounds on one of the rocks. The rock and three others unfold into some hooved humanoid creatures. They start to try to detain us.  [[Vela Callisto|Vela]] manages to talk to them and learn that they are the "defenders" of the area. They say they'll let us go but first asks for Vela's name.  Vela was smart enough to give a fake name. They release those of us they had constrained. 

We continue on our trip up the mountain. We encounter 3 corpses in the road. All wearing the [[Mask guys]] armor. [[Vela Callisto|Vela]] loots them and finds some orders in a hidden compartment [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] pointed out to them. The orders were to go spy on the [[Oracle]]. It appears they were killed by large wild animals.

We reach some more well kept staircase area, decide to stop to rest for the first day. [[Anuva Moonbeam|Anuva]] sets up an alarm around the camp site. [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] and [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] do watch for the first shift. They talk about sleeping and sleeping patterns of different cultures, the pros and cons. Legions leaves to sleep after first shift as Kat stays on watch.

### Day Two
We head up the stairs in the morning, they branch off in multiple pathways. [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] uses their little guy to see where they all lead. 4 paths lead to caves and one continues up the mountain. Legion sends their little guy and raven familiar into two of the caves. They find a gigantic humanoid statues at the end of them. Sent down the other 2 caves and saw the same statue. The statue seems to be related to a history of some tools the school's overseer can control. We are going to pass on investigating on these caves and statues. 

We continue walking for majority of the day. Late evening we start to approach a small wooden cabin. [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] casts detect magic on their little guy to investigate the house. It's radiating with magic, upon touching it the [[Oracle]] appears behind us and asks why we are up here. 

[[Vela Callisto|Vela]] brings out the petition to make Celeste a full student. [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] right away tells the Oracle that her signature on the petition is forged as she did not sign it.
We tell the [[Oracle]] about how we were present at [[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]]'s
