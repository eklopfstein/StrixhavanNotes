[[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]], [[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]], and [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] finish our beers and head towards the teacher housing to continue looking for [[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]]'s soul. We find nothing so we retire for the night with the plan to check during history class tomorrow.

[[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] decides to start a nightly routine of keeping good communication at night. They have their little guy keep an eye on [[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]] and their raven watch the hallway around [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] and [[Vela Callisto|Vela]]'s room.

The next day we all go to history class and continue to look for the gem. The particular gem with Huffdinger's soul is not here but a gem of the same type is in her desk. We use message to discuss how we might be able to get the gem.
[[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] uses Prestidigitation to pretend to have her first period to drag [[Professor Makayla|Makayla]] out of the room so we can take the gem. The gem appears to be a dark purple version of the gem that the [[Object Army]] uses to control objects.

## Study The Stone
We use [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]]'s room and Private Sanctum to discuss the crystal. [[Grayson]] was in the room but we kicked him out. Touching it does not impact anyone. Seems to be likely that it is a stronger version of the object army crystal.
We look into the ingredients of the spell the object army was casting to power their gem.

Dying deer - likely killed in casting and used to power the spell
Green crystal - what the result of the spell would be stored in
"Spices"
Sage
Bone Marrow (necromancy)
Feywild tree sap (containment)

Would be a good idea to try to look into how the containment portion works and how one could undo it.
