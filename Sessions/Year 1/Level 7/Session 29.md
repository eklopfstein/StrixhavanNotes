First Tuesday session as two new players start today
## Time Skip
We advance to the last few weeks of the school year. The cults have seemed to settled down as the high activity lately has made the school quite dangerous. The school is having a service for [[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]]. 
[[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] prepares for the service and heads to the [[Biblioplex]]. [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] stays behind to clean. Tasha goes to look in Huffdinger's office, can't get past locked. Gives up and goes research for a project.
[[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] decides to wait for Kat to make an appearance in the shared space. They talk for a bit about the upcoming service and the death of Huffdinger. Legion asks about what to wear to this event and checks up on how Kat is handling the death.
[[Vela Callisto|Vela]] is out playing catch with Celeste.

We meet at the [[Biblioplex]] an hour before the service. [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] is floating on their magic broom while studying. [[Vela Callisto|Vela]] comes in riding Celeste, leave them at the door as they are not allowed in.
An argument has sprung up about Tasha and Vela being so focused on Celeste being allowed in the [[Biblioplex]] instead of caring about/mourning [[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]]. We head to the service.

## [[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]] Service
[[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]] is providing flowers for the service.

[[Seraphine Amsodeus|Seraphine]] is at the service just trying to blend in. She is keeping cookies for later in her bag.
[[Anuva Moonbeam|Anuva]] is reading a book off to the side of everyone. [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] catches their eye as they are interested in constructs. 

[[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] is very confused by the fact that Anuva is as small as their little guy but is able to talk and think unlike the little guy. Anuva did not like Legion pointing out they could be killed by a book being dropped on them. Anuva moves away.

The service goes on, [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] gives leaves she made for [[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]] with him. Everyone pays respects to him. There are cookies from the freshmen [[Cafeteria]] at the event, Huffdinger's favorite. 

Legion says hi to [[Seraphine Amsodeus|Seraphine]] by stating that they cannot be killed by a book. The whole group begins speaking with them. [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] attempts to make good conversation with them and fails horribly. Whole group, including Seraphine, start discussing the possibility of Anuva being killed by a book.

## Next Moves
As we go to leave, [[Grayson]] cuts us off at the door. He says we are very boring to watch. Asks if we have any plans to take actions against any of the cults. Noticing that the new players are listening in we move to a private area and use Mordenkainenâ€™s Private Sanctum to debrief them on the fact that they will either need to work with us or be killed by [[Grayson]]. They agree. 
[[Grayson]] asks us to look into the [[Oracle]] and possibly find out how she used the [[Snarl]] from the top of the mountains. We agree to go up there. Plan to use the death of [[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]] and the arrival of the two new members as our reason to come to speak with them.
