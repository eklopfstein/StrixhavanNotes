Tribe was mega late so we ran a late and short session


The teachers grapple [[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]] as [[Vela Callisto|Vela]] and [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] talk him down. Once calmed down, they let him go and we all went to the garden to talk about [[Professor Makayla|Makayla]]. We discuss what we can do about our knowledge . 
We ask the [[Voice]] about what he knows, not sure where [[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]]'s soul is but Makayla casted a spell when he died that seems to charge a crystal she was hiding. He describes it enough for us to use locate object. We walk past her office and the ruins and do not get a ping, but she is not in her office. Plan to walk by the teacher's housing to see if she is there and/or the crystal. But stopping at [[Kermit's Girls]] to get food.

[[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]] wants a beer but they won't give him one. [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] steps outside and uses alter self to appear as [[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]]'s uncle grandpa, goes up to order beers. Given a hard time for being on campus as a random adult. 
[[Kermit]] gets some teachers to investigate it and they try to interrogate Legion. Legion keeps the lie that they are Ubbe's uncle grandpa and got lost after dropping him off. Teacher uses dispel magic and Legion counter spells and accusing them of trying to fireball him and calls all magic users the same. 
Teacher falsely accuses Legion of casting a spell which they adamantly denies. They give up and sell them the beers, pays and tips 1 gold and pinch of sand.

Once Kermit is busy, [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] demorphs back and rejoins the group at the table. Pours out the juice Kermit gave Ubbe and puts the beers in the glass, leaves mugs at the bar.
