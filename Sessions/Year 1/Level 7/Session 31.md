## [[Oracle]] Convo
After the failed attempt to get the [[Oracle]] to sign the petition, [[Vela Callisto|Vela]] and [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] move on to trying to get the founders, dragons, to sign the petition.

[[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] suggest stepping inside to discuss the events that led to [[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]]'s death because it is cold outside, she agrees.
The house appears to be a pretty normal log house despite the extremely high magic presence. 
Inside we noticed a study on the far wall and one other closed door. We enter in a living room/dinning room area. 

We discuss our plans to learn more about "what Huffdinger learned" that got him killed. We mention that something in the [[Ruins]] was what got him killed so we would need search down there to find it. Since we no longer have him to cover for us we would need her to do so. 
She refuses to do so, mentions safety as the reason. 

[[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] suggest the idea that a spy is within the [[Teacher's Anti-Cult Cult]] who leaked the info. This peaks the [[Oracle]]'s attention as they say investigating a possible spy would be safer than going into the [[Ruins]].

The [[Oracle]] uses ley lines connected to the [[Snarl]] to use it from afar. The oracle can always see the Snarl and can teleport to it at a moments notices. Anyone in the inner cricle can disable the Snarl's defenses. [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] mentions that the [[Mask guys]] have [[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]]'s soul, might use his knowledge to disable it.

[[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] gets permission to look into what the Oracle has in their study while [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] talks to them about trinkets in hope to keep them distracted. It has plenty of research from the school. Found a map of the [[Ruins]] and got permission to take it with us for use on our trip. Found research about use of the [[Snarl]], tends to backfire. Found hidden book 4 from [[The Dark One]] books. [[Vela Callisto|Vela]] tried to cover up the sound of the hidden room opening but fails horribly. [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] tries to find a way that we can prove ourselves to the [[Oracle]] Made deal that if we get book 3, we can get book 4 from her. Book 4 has the location of half the sword needed.

We are teleported back to the [[Dorms]] by the Oracle.
