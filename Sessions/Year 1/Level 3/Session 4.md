Another small attendance day :(

### Morning 
[[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] Looks for Kat and does not find her. Heads to the [[Cafeteria]].
[[Nebin]] Goes to the library to find lore on [[Inquisitor of the Sword]] finds almost nothing. Heads to the cafeteria. 
[[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] Goes straight to the cafeteria. 
>"I'm going to whisper sweet nothings into their spines." [[Nebin]] as he prepares to bring more books into his hareem

[[Nebin]] drinks tea for breakfast, offensive to all tea drinkers worldwide. 
Nebin and Tasha talk and Nebin bores on, I wasn't fully listening but I remember the topic was not important.

As Nebin and Tasha try to leave Legion's Raven harass them for the fun of it.

### To Classes
[[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] Learned how to do a magic trick with a card. [[Infused magic]]

[[Nebin]] learns how to tell if a berry is poisonous, which he already knows. [[Herbology]]

[[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] had a weird teacher, we got a giant pile of books and told to prepare to debate the ethic of healing without consent. [[Control and Magical Ethics]]

---
### After class
[[Nebin]] tries the library again and this time successfully finds details on [[Inquisitor of the Sword]]. He also buys a herbalism kit.
[[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] wants to go to the bowling alley but it is closed for maintenance. 
[[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] goes sightseeing through the raven.

We all go to lunch in the [[Cafeteria]].
[[Nebin]] shares the info he learned.
She was an angle who helped a lich and became a fallen angle. 

[[Nebin]] proceeds to talk out loud to a voice in his head... He's lost it.
The [[Voice]] tells him that the [[Inquisitor of the Sword and Co]] are trying to resurrect [[The Dark One]]. The voice used to work with her.
Nebin ask who is speaking to him and is told names are irrelevant and physical form is unnecessary. 

[[Nebin]] and [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] discuss whether it was magic or drugs. Nebin does a poor job of proving it wasn't drugs.

### To the library
[[Nebin]] prepares to fuck the books upon entrance.

[[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] finds a book about [[The Dark One]].
It is an old leather-back book, cover image is him depicted [[Dark One.png]].
The book itself is vague but it tells us speaking of [[The Dark One]] is taboo and is a necromancer. 
We decide to head to [[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]]'s office to inform them of this.

### To Professor Huffdinger
We tell him about everything and he does not believe it. He tries to say the school is too secure to enable the [[Inquisitor of the Sword]] to sneak in. We mention the terrorist attack just earlier this week.
We mention [[The Dark One]] and show the book we found on it.
We get him to preform a private investigation. 
He informs us that they would need the [[Snarl]] to resurrect him. This means both the [[Inquisitor of the Sword and Co]] and [[Mask guys]] are going after the Snarl. There is likely more groups.
We try to pry more but he tells us to stay out of it and we head back to our rooms for the night.
