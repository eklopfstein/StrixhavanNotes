[[Mask guys]] mask changes their voice. Kat admits to having seen him.
He offers a deal.
Him and his people can move freely in the dorms and Tasha will not be hurt.
She kind of agrees and is told other workers have been given similar deals.

### We leave the [[Cafeteria]] for the job
[[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] Leads us to the professor's office for the job.
The dolls got out with a pin in them that they can use to steal bodies. They got loose last night. If they take a body they can then speak but do not have the memories of who they stole the body from.
The professor took us to their old holding cells. Looks like "a daycare" and the pin is now empty. There is a small hole in the wall. we discuss the dolls until [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] mentions Grayson, one of the [[Mask guys]], and everyone gets worried.
