Far better attendance today :) 
Still took until 7:15 to start though

### Back in the dorms 
While cleaning [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] see a purple fog moving around the dorms that seem like the same the [[Mask guys]] use. She holds her deal with [[Grayson]] and ignores it.
[[Vela Callisto|Vela]] HAD 4 livers. Had.

Next morning. 
[[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] Goes to buy material to try to make a copy of herself.
[[Vela Callisto|Vela]] and [[Nebin]] discuss the past few days, particularly Nebin's book fucking and drug addiction, while eating breakfast.

## Tribe is a nerd who paid attention in high school

Vela heads out to the woods to relax, Nebin warns her that it will rain soon. [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] sends his raven to scare Vela. The raven drops a glass of water on Vela, calls her a nerd, and flies away. 

[[Dean Long]] approaches Legion in the [[Cafeteria]]. He stands beside Legion and asks them to gather their friends and meet him at an address he gave. Legion asked for permission to listen to [[Vela Callisto|Vela]] again and is given it.
Legion goes to Vela first as they know where she is. After getting her [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] sends the Raven to look for [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] and [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] as they go to the library to get [[Nebin]].

### The Library
[[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] heads to the library to talk with [[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]]. [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] is still in her room. The raven finds Tasha and bullies her into going to the library. 

The raven returns to [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]]  and buys water with a silver coin from Legion and dumps it on [[Vela Callisto|Vela]]. [[Nebin]] then kills the raven. Vela gets [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]]'s attention and we learn Kat plans on making a dog doll like her. 

>"I don't want to hear morals from someone who fucks books" [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] to [[Nebin]] the [[Nebin|Book Fucker]]

We have a long discussion about the morals of creating a dog doll that might become sentient and of book fucking. Kat informs Nebin that he cannot reproduce with a book. It is pondered that if a sentient doll were to fuck a book, could they reproduce.

### Anti-Cult Cult Meeting
We head to the address that [[Dean Long]] gave [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]].

It is an open field with a cellar door in it, because no one would ever find that, and it is raining. The door is locked on the inside so [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] knocks. Someone on the inside ask who it is and Legion says that it is the people they asked for to talk to about the terrorist. [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] is panicking about the rain. They unlock the door and Legion opens it. and there are stairs down but no person down there. 

# [[Nebin]] is a coward and a book fucker

[[Nebin]] is afraid of going down the stairs. The room at the bottom of the stairs seems to be covered with parts of an investigation, to an extreme amount. [[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]] is also here. there are 12 people down here.

The people seemed worried that the Dean invited children to this meeting until Legion said that they are friends with one of the terrorist. They ask us to define friends, Legion explains how they meet and Kat gives the literal definition. 

Kat mentions that she started working on creating another doll. She is told not to talk about it right now. We learn that this people are a [[Teacher's Council]] secretly made to deal with the groups going after the [[Snarl]].

The teachers mention that they know of 5 groups so far trying to get the [[Snarl]] and do not know any of their reasons. We knew more than them, losers. This triggers a whole argument of why the school was left open after the snarl was made. They think it is not possible to stop all of the groups so they are trying to identify all groups and their goals so they can aid the least dangerous one. We mention they could use the Snarl to stop them but they say that it is hard to control and is dangerous to use. [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] suggest that they draw straws to see who should try to use it.

When asking about who decides which group to help they say that they planned on picking students to make the final decision and since we basically forced our way in it will be us. They will likely still have some input on limiting down the options.

The bodiless voice that talked to [[Nebin]] talks to all of us telling us it will not work with us. 

They found a necklace in [[Grayson]]'s room and when it is used they are in the armor of the [[Mask guys]]. They say they have not been able to find Grayson since then but [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] mentions he has seen him walking at night. Grayson has somehow continued to turn in his homework despite not being seen. Legion asks for the armor and [[Dean Long]] gives it to him despite other members disagreeing. We plan on sneaking into the mask guys group to learn their motive.
