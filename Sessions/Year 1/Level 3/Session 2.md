[[Tribe]]'s chinese, rice and pork, arrived before session started
According to [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]]'s data, stat rolling is best for names that start with early alphabetical letters  
First 10 minutes spent talking (Some things never change)

### Resume history class
Told to ask a construct teacher about the Carrionettes. [[Vela Callisto|Vela]] asked question about the forest, not answered. No homework assigned. [[Nebin]] talked with the professor a bit about her magic and learned more about our necromancy specialization. [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] and [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] discussed the Carrionettes and [[Mask guys]] openly which gets weird looks from the classmates and professor.

Jordan failed to remember my out of game so we all redid introductions. He thought my name was Adrian. Also kept referring to Legion in game as Adrian as well.

[[Nebin]] looks into the history of poetry. We are a party of giants and midgets. Class ends.

## [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] start to walk to the [[Oracle]]
Went to ask a tour guide robot about how to get to the oracle but was told that they are at the top of a mountain that takes 2 hours to climb and is a deadly adventure. We instead ask about how to find the deans and then ask about finding the dean of theory. told to find him at his lab and followed robot to there.

Knocks on the door of the lab and is invited in. Meets [[Dean Long]], Dean of Theory. Told him about the [[Mask guys]] and [[Grayson]] through thoughts since it does not break [[Vela Callisto|Vela]] rules. The dean says that they will look into this and to not listen to Vela anymore.

## [[Vela Callisto|Vela]] and [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] head to a restaurant 
They ask a cleaner where the nearest restaurant is and get directions. The cleaner lost their taste buds in "The War". The party members head to the sandwich sub they got directions to and she mostly school staff there.

[[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] makes up numbers for their meals. They are told no but then told that their order will be right up. They were given numbers, they realized it was a trick they tend to pull on new students.

## [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] and [[Nebin]] head to the [[Biblioplex]]
[[Nebin]] complains about lack of accessibility to books while kat climbs the walls to get to the second floor. Nebin takes part time job putting away books.

[[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] goes to [[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]]'s office. She ask about the dream needles of the Carrionettes and asks if there is any way to find them magically. The professor says that it is possible if we have the needed magic. She gets a description of the needles from the professor. She has a staring contest with a doll in the corner. They discuss the creation of Kat's people and Kat wants to reverse engineer herself. 

The two members talk and learn more about each other.

## Everyone heads back to the dorms
>"You can learn a lot by being a terrorist" [[Nebin]]

[[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] shares her idea for finding the Carrionettes and introduces us to [[Nebin]]. [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] mentions their conversation with the dean and says they have to disregard anything [[Vela Callisto|Vela]] say. 
Kat mentions putting the Carrionettes in mason jars. *scared Theo sounds*
The whole party agrees to depart for the Carrionettes now. Nebin finds a dream needle nearby.

## Party follows [[Nebin]] to the dream needle
>"No open carry on campus" [[Tribe]]
>''There is no non murder use of a rapier" [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]]
>"Sometimes you need a rapier to cut cheese" [[Nebin]]

Leads to a cathedral that we go into.
we try to stealth in and succeed with an average 16 roll. 
A group of cloaked figures are standing around the dolls, we cant hear them but [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] can read lips.

The doll's boss is withholding an area from them which is keeping them far from the [[Snarl]]. [[Nebin]] thinks the leader is pretty, therefore good. [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] climbs on the ceiling and is caught by [[Inquisitor of the Sword]] but she thinks kat is with the dolls. Kat pretends to be with the dolls and has them join her on their way out.
[[Nepenthe]] is the leader of some group and the inquisitor does not trust it. Everyone left inside follows Kat outside.
