[[Tribe]] ran 7 minutes late (playing GTA roleplaying smh).
We discussed escape rooms and axe throwing while waiting.
[[Nebin]] has left the group. No more #BookFucking 

### Leaving Anti-Cult Cult Meeting
It is still raining as we leave the meeting. [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] is clutching her coat. We decide to discuss our plans while eating at a restaurant. we find a sports bar, [[Kermit's Girls]], we discuss the sports that take place at this school and if it's deadly. 

[[Aster]], a new nerd is reading a book at this sports bar. We find a table away from Aster but not too far away that would make us look suspicious. [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] starts casting Find Familiar to get their raven back. [[Kermit]], the owner, comes to take our order. They have a deal running on the "Why did you leave you fucking whore" ribs.
Aster talks to Legion through their mind. Legion asks if Aster is the bodiless voice that plans on killing the school, he says no. He also talks to [[Vela Callisto|Vela]] through thoughts a bit, about genitalia,  and then joins us at the table. Aster says their people do not write things down so Legion mentions how their people write everything down. They discuss the pros and cons of over and under documentation. 
Legion has Aster pick a number and the number leads to them telling Aster about the [[Teacher's Council]] and their goal. Aster and [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] talk about animals. 
[[Kermit]] comes back with our food. Aster eats a soup that was brought out in error. It was blended blood and ghost peppers. 
As Legion summons their raven they notice [[Grayson]] walking by the restaurant.

### Following [[Grayson]]
We walk outside to talk with the raven. The Raven is sent to follow him from about 10-20 feet behind him and we're 40-50 feet behind the raven. We notice the thing we are following is an illusion and the real [[Grayson]] is behind us. [[Aster]] Tries to read his thoughts and succeeds. He is thinking about which spell to use, he summons a demon. [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] panics and dons the [[Mask guys]] armor. 
[[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] lies out of their ass about their intentions to [[Grayson]] and makes him think they planned on joining the group to help them fight the others. [[Mask guys]] have the intention of toppling the [[New Gods]]. We are tasked with finding out what he means by toppling the new gods and by doing this we can get an audience with their leaders. He leaves the Shadow Demon he spawned as he teleports away, initiative starts. 

[[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]]'s milf almost died but by the end [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] puts the demon to sleep and we all get free crits to kill it as it only had 5 HP left and is unconscious.
