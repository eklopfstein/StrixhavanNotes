### Start
We all walk into the [[Biblioplex]] and see people with little cards seemingly looking for something.

We learn only the bearer can read the card.

as we wait for the card a bodiless voice greets us and gives us our cards.
"Having fun"
Cards are for a scavenger hunt which we all go about doing the task(s) given to us.

Big ugly guy and co ([[Mask guys]]) crash the party

He calls out to the leaders of the school. He wants something they have and will kill a person an hour.

The snarl shoots out tons of magic and attacks them as they run away.

### We get back to the [[Dorms]]
[[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] gets a job cleaning the dorm areas. 
[[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] is offered to join a night raid under the lie that it is a greeting ceremony.
They join and follows the guys through the girls side. They notices that the leader of the group is one of the [[Mask guys]] people. When they are about to get caught he teleports himself and legion out to safety. The reaming boys are caught and punished by having their gender swapped.

The next morning we have a list of [[Classes]] we can register for, total of 6 classes where one must be history.
