[[Tribe]] is devouring fried chicken 
## Through The Woods
At breakfast [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] brings up the info she got from [[Nepenthe]] about where they get their crystals. We decide to go there after eating, will use [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]]'s little guy to cast detect magic through to try to find the mine.
Kat decides to go to the nurse to get her curse removed so Legion heads to the [[Rainbow Bookstores|The Brown Book]] to inform the owner he is back and to set up a work schedule. 

We meet at the edge of the forest to head west. Legion decides to send their little guy above the trees to see if there is a clear spot where a mine entrance might be. There is, no detect magic needed.

There is almost no wild life. Legion asks Kat to use See Invisibility to keep an eye out, she agrees. Mine is only 8.8 minutes away and this will last for an hour.

[[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]] and [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] are flirting and giving flowers to each other. 
Tasha is talking about how Ubbe gets bigger around her.
We continue walking.

## [[Object Army]] "Mines"
We reach the mines and Legion sends their little guy in a it is wacked out. Legion resummons it and sends it in again, passes save this time. [[Vela Callisto|Vela]] and [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] buff [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] to help her save, she does. 
Was the power of the crystals, like when she touches it but without touching it.

Place has a ton of blood, some old some new. There is a rock about the size of a 3-story building with stairs leading to the top. Blood seems to flow down the stairs.

Legion now uses Detect Magic to check the place out. The blood is not magically. The rock has tons of magic. Transmutation, Abjuration, and Necromancy going from a single point at the top. 
Legion sends their little guy straight up, sees 5 floating knives and a deer. 4 of the knives are pining down the deer on a large green crystal. Last Knife is mixing up magical components, likely the magic Legion detected. 

We talk about what they might be doing.
Control people?
Summon something?
Create more crystals?

We settle on create crystals as they said this is where they get them and there is no mine in sight. 
We decide to try to interrupt the casting and find out what components they use.

Quick save in case this doesn't work.

[[Vela Callisto|Vela]] buffs [[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]] so he can charge in and attempt to stop the one mixing components. [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] continues to flirt with him.
