Sessions to move to Tuesdays starting next week
Ubbe will no longer be able to make it :(

## Next Morning
We are able to get cleaned up and take a long rest. We head to breakfast in the [[Cafeteria]].
[[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] has a connection with [[Nepenthe]] as their champion. [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] is lactose intolerant. 
[[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] asks Kat to keep us updated about their relationship, Nepenthe tries to get Kat to not do that. Kat sides with Legion. 

Someone approaches us who is using an illusion to cover their identity. It is [[Grayson]], he wants to speak with us. [[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]] plans on telling the [[Teacher's Anti-Cult Cult]] about what we learned in the [[Ruins]]. [[Mask guys]] has sent a strike team to stop him. We're going to use Locate Object to try to find Huffdinger by his gun.

We stop by the [[Biblioplex]] to see if he is in his office. It is locked down so [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] sends their little guy in to see if he is in his office. He is not. We leave to check the [[Teacher's Anti-Cult Cult]]'s known meeting place. On the way their Legion gets a ping from Locate Object at some nearby housing.

## [[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]]'s House
[[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] uses their little guy to look through a window. There is a living room with [[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]] getting ready to leave.

Two plans.
Knock on door and talk him out of it.
Knock on door as the [[Oracle]].

Party does not want to trick him so [[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]] knocks on the door. Huffdinger opens the door and asks why we are there. We ask to speak inside. 
Looking around we see faint purple blurs zapping around the area.
We head inside.

We try to warn him about the pending attack. He seems not fully willing to trust us. [[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]] and [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] express their care and love for Huffdinger. [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] expresses their lack of sympathy but desire to keep them alive.  

We gaslight [[Tribe]].

[[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]] tries to shoot [[Grayson]]. [[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]] stops him and [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] pushes Grayson out of the way in case Ubbe failed to stop him. The strike team comes in, Ubbe jumps out a window with Huffdinger. Starts a fight.

[[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] give them hypothermia with the cone of cold + fireball combo.

[[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]] and most of the [[Mask guys]] die in the fight. Call truce once the Mask Guys were down to one person. Taking Huffdinger to the [[Professor Makayla|Makayla]] in hopes to revive him. 
We see the her come out and ask for [[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]] to hand over Huffdinger. She cannot revive him. Ubbe give him one last low five. She takes him away.

We try to go to the meeting that the [[Teacher's Anti-Cult Cult]] was having but they seem to have canceled it.

## Level up to level 7

# [[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]]'s Obituary
It is with great euphoria that we announce the timely, but not soon enough, death of [[Ubbe Blackshield]] in [[Session 28]].

[[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]] Was a fine idiot; some would say the best idiot. He sought stupidity where others thought impossible, created issues where he found perfection, and frequently succumbed to lust. But most importantly, he was our dear acquittance. 
[[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]]'s time was short lived, a mere 14 sessions. But the problems he has caused will live on in each of us for many more unwieldy sessions to come. His distasteful memory will be dreadfully thought back upon as we face possible death time and time again.

A service to drink until we forget about [[Ubbe Blackshield]] will be held during the time between now and the next session. At this service we will be accepting donations to the "Euthanize Stupid Kids" charity. 
For every 10 gold coins donated, Ubbe will be resurrected and killed again.

With love,
[[Certiorari of De Novo]]
