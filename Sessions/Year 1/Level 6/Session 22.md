Tasha was late because they were playing Overwatch 2, note of shame
"My brother was playing it"
Ubbe was also late but was overshadowed by Tasha
## Post Terrorism Pt 2
We see the area is secure and decide that we are no longer needed. During the events [[Grayson]] snuck off and [[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]] is helping at the medical tent.

[[Vela Callisto|Vela]] suggests going to the church where we first encountered [[Inquisitor of the Sword]] because when she disappeared to protect her book she might have left the church unmanned. Or went there. Using [[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]]'s background feature we are able to move twice as fast through the campus and get to the church in roughly 15 minutes going at a fast pace. 
Before leaving, [[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]] decides to talk to [[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]] about the attack that happened. [[Professor Huffdinger|Huffdinger]] tells him to ask the rest of the group because "They are really good at hiding secrets". We tell him a little bit about it.

## Church
We get to the church and [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] sends in their spectral mind in to recon the place. Does not see anything. We walk in and [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] uses their see invisibility to check the room for people, sees no one but some elementals are following us in the Etheral Plane. We look around the main room and [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] is able to find a button on the altar to open a hidden compartment with half a book in it. It is clearly a trap.

We look into a closet in the back of the room. Seems to be a storage room with old church supplies. Struggling to find anything, [[Vela Callisto|Vela]] super looks into the room and finally manages to notice things.
Vela notices that the dust cannot be wiped off, it is an illusion. 
The area with the match boxes and candles have less dust than other areas. [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] starts to magically light the candles but we have him stop so we can think through this first. [[Vela Callisto|Vela]] moves a table and sees the fake dust does not move with it. 
When the candles are lit with the matches they light up with a black flame that emits darkness. Upon lighting all of them they change to a reddish black flame and it starts to fill the room with smoke. 
We close the door and block the gap under the door with the robes. We find ourselves in total darkness as the room fills with smoke quickly. A bit after [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] opens the door and sees we are gone. After much debate with [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]], [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] lights the candles by themselves; leave Kat behind alone.

## Split Up The Party (Through Time?)
The group inside the closet find themselves seemingly back in time when this church was first constructed. [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] uses the button on the altar, in the compartment is now the second half of the first book of the [[The Dark One]]. Legion takes it and then [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] appears. They are scolded for leaving [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] alone and vulnerable. 

Back to regular time with Kat.
[[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] hears [[Vela Callisto|Vela]]'s drake start alerting at a campus tour guide who is glowing green. The tour guide walks in and points up at Kat's bag that has the gem from [[Nepenthe]]. It appears the tour guide is part of the [[Object Army]]. The tour guide seems to want Kat to use the gem. Kat questions the tour guide on its use of the gem and the effects. After much talk Kat ends up touch the gem without a glove and ends up talking with [[Nepenthe]]. 
The sword asks about Kat's willingness to commit to the [[Object Army]]. She continues to avoid committing anything. The sword tells her to go west into the forest beyond the school. Claims she will find where they are getting the gems from. Kat leaves the area where they talk with the sword and sees that the tour guide has left.

Back to the seemingly past with the rest.
[[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] sends their little guy to look under the front door, notices there is a bunch of nothing out there. We are in a pocket dimension. [[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]] is punching the walls for some reason.
Before trying to leave Legion does one last sweep of this area. They find a map of "Ravenloft", some unknown continent, and pieces of smaller gem stones that have seemingly been broken by magic surging through them.  
The [[Voice]] says that a neanderthal destroyed it. Said to ask a person known as Theo who did it. He was one of the [[Disgracers]].  After talking we seem to both fear that the [[Inquisitor of the Sword]] was likely trying to remake Ravenloft with the gems they have been using. We decide to use the candles to go back to the regular plane.

## Back Together
We join back together and [[Vela Callisto|Vela]] calls their drake back in as [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] sends their little guy under the door to see if anyone is coming. They can see [[Inquisitor of the Sword]] flying at them very fast. We have about 2 rounds before they reach us. 
We end session here as we decide what to do out of character with only a few minutes left in real life session time.
