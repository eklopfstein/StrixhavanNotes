Ubbe is sad without his girlfriend
## Mercy
As [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] walks into the room the objects in there look at her for a moment and then start to attack. Kat simply puts her weapon down and [[Nepenthe]] seems pleased, the objects stand down. Kat notices that one of the knifes looks like it can function like a key. Kat asks it to allow her to use it to unlock the door, it agrees. We head to unlock the other door.

## Leap Of Faith
[[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] and [[Vela Callisto|Vela]] start walking down the stairs, [[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]] sleds down them. About a mile down Ubbe sees some statue on the wall. It is a statue of an old adventurer who is wielding a weapon that looks like [[Nepenthe]]. plague reads "Only those with faith my reach the bottom". Ubbe talks about his undying faith in [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]]. He continues to ride down the stairs.

After much walking, Kat and Vela reach the statue. As they are looking at it they start to hear the sound of [[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]] sliding down the stairs at them as he looped back around. He speeds past them as he continues to think about "getting big". Last moment decides to stop.

[[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]], seeing how far down they are decides to free fall and use feather fall near the end to avoid getting hurt. 

The group realizes that the "faith" is by jumping down the center. They jump down letting [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] go first for padding. [[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]] cheats on [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] with [[Vela Callisto|Vela]].

There is a pond about 15 feet deep they land in.

## Kat (Lady) Of The Pond
As we land in the water we see a version of [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] standing by the water. 
[[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] was there first so they were chilling at the bottom of the pond.
Rest of the group shows up and help Kat out of the water. They see the other Kat. Legion sees this and decides to Alter Self to look like Kat before emerging from the water.

The fake Kat is guarding a door. Says it leads to her final trial but implies that we cannot go with her. Kat heads in by herself, the copy tells her "Good luck against the failed champion".

## Failed Champion
[[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] finds herself in a very empty room. There are many broken objects about the room and on the far end there is a glass golem glowing with radiant light. There is a pile of crystals next to it. They fight, Kat kills it with the [[Nepenthe]] sword thing she has.

[[Nepenthe]] declares [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] their champion but challenges them to find the real sword. What appeared to be a pile of gems was actually pieces of the golem that they have shoot at past contenders. Kat takes a shard of glass from the remains of the golem and walks out.

The fake Kat tells the real [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] they won't be getting the real version of the sword but will get something else. They then fall apart letting free a bunch of gold as their reward (1000 gp). Kat decides to split the gold with the party but she keeps 150 of [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]]'s to keep it safe.

## Escape
Still disguised as Kat, [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] looks for an exit in the pond. [[Vela Callisto|Vela]] follows. Vela finds an exit. They go up to inform the group of it. Kat is very hesitant. Still as Kat, Legion goes up and tries to take her hand to lead her down. Kat is scared of them being wet but uses Prestidigitation to dry their hand. The group goes down. Everyone except Vela is pulled into a small tunnel. Vela follows. We see a ending and what sounds like a waterfall.

We launch out near the top of the [[Oracle]]'s mountain. [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] uses feather fall on the whole group. [[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]] and [[Vela Callisto|Vela]] don't notice as they have their eyes seal shut. Ubbe out of excitement and Vela out of fear. [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] and Legion land on land and both use Prestidigitation to dry her. Legion finally demorphs from their Kat disguise. 

Kat is going to find a sewing club to fix her up. 
Ubbe is going to go tend to the flowers angrily. 
Vela and Legion and just heading to the dorms.

There is a small blue tent in a marketplace with a sign that says "Coming Soon".
