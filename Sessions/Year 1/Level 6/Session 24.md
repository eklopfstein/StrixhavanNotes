Tasha decide to take a cold shower in middle of November, 9 minutes before session
## Try To Find [[Grayson]]
During the night Grayson decide to visit [[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]] in his sleep. They both make fun of how empty Ubbe's head is. 
Ubbe decides to tell a ton of shit to Grayson now, because he somehow never learns his lesson. Informs him about the books about [[The Dark One]], that [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] has them, and basic info about [[Inquisitor of the Sword]]. He also decides to do his gardening before rushing to inform us.

He starts by going to the female dorms to get the girls but is being followed by [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]]'s little guy. [[Vela Callisto|Vela]] does not want to get up but will when hearing that [[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]] spoke with [[Grayson]].  He then goes to talk with [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] and get pulled into their room to talk more, little guy follows, looking pissed and ready to cast fireball.
They decide to meet in the [[Biblioplex]] with [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]]. A long conversation goes on in the [[Biblioplex]] talking about how we can find [[Grayson]] and inform him of the pending attack. Legion uses Locate Object to find Grayson's rod that [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] wanted so badly. It leads back to [[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]]'s room where Grayson was leaving a note. The note was to tell Ubbe where to leave the books.

## Give Warning 
We began talking with [[Grayson]] and [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] makes up a letter that they found in [[Inquisitor of the Sword]]'s pocket dimension that leads us to believe they have spies within the [[Mask guys]] and have learned the identity of [[The Bishop]]. Grayson seems to not believe that the inquisitor of the sword is actually still alive and believes the person we met is an imposter. So legion provides him with the first half of the first book that just gives a short overview of [[The Dark One]] and that he can be brought back to life. Telling Grayson to bring that back to [[The Bishop]] and inform him that the inquisitor will likely be coming for him. Despite seemingly still believing it is an imposter he agrees to take the info back to the Bishop for that is his current job. 

For future contact it has been established that we will leave one of [[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]]'s hammers under [[Grayson]]'s bed at night and that would tell him to meet us in Ubbe's room the next morning. Grayson agrees to this and leaves to give this information to the Bishop.
