Today's notes brought to you by [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]]
[[Tribe]]'s Doordash guy wanted to meet her across town in a potshop, once told no only delivered the food, doordash redid the order with drink. Food in question was a burger.

## The Combat in the [[Object Army]] “Mines” 
The party engages in a fight with five enchanted knives that were attacking and pinning down a deer, the knives are assumedly connected to the [[Object Army]] given the location the party was in and their actions on the deer. 

The Knives attempt to run as [[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]] alerts them to the party's location. Ubbe, with a fly spell from [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]], and [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]], on their flying broom, managed to keep up with the knife's movement to continue the fight. 
[[Vela Callisto|Vela]] and Kat, knowing they can’t keep up, listen to Kat’s suggestion to stay at the large crystal and Vela puts the deer out of its misery. Kat teaches Vela how to play Three-Dragon Ante as they have small talk waiting at the exit. 

[[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]] and [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] get lured into a fight in a 25 by 25 foot room. Ubbe going in first, hits a knife into a wooden table in the room. and proceeds to get punched by the table. The fight now is Ubbe and Tash versus fives flying knives, one animated table, a bookshelf full of books, a suit of metal, a ballista, and a wizard's staff. Ubbe and Tash ran, but lied to [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] and [[Vela Callisto|Vela]] saying they won the fight. 

[[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] was made to make another wisdom saving throw, only landing an 8, she fails and [[Nepenthe]] begins to talk to Kat, telling her a new trail begins. An enchanted transparent longsword appears in her hands. She also has a new feeling in her. She shares this information with the party. The party thinks about whether to leave the cave early or not, [[Vela Callisto|Vela]] and [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] vote to stay, while [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] and [[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]] vote to leave. When asked for her opinion Kat says she’d like to learn more about ‘her people’ guilting Tasha and Ubbe to stay.

## Into The Mines
[[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] and [[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]] say they’re looking ahead and have a conversation about the effects of the Cave on [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]], they didn’t do much ‘scouting’. 
They follow down a hallway, Kat making a map and waving to the inanimate objects as they pass. Ubbe casts darkness trying to hide away their lost fight, it surprises [[Vela Callisto|Vela]] making her push the issue further. Vela and Kat considered and went down the path Tasha and Ubba asked them to, only to meet a locked door, forcing them down the original path. The room where they previously fought in, Kat went in alone, facing all the objects.
