Vela decided to work
## Being Hunted
We decide to leave [[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]] in the church with the smell of drugs in the air. He has a candle by him to explain the smell of the incense. The rest of us leave through a window using [[Vela Callisto|Vela]]'s pass without a trace. [[Katherine of Goldenwell|Kat]] gives Ubbe inspiration to help him pretend to be a random stoner. 

[[Inquisitor of the Sword]] Comes in the door in her nun disguise. She seems to fall for the setup but then decides the try to charm Ubbe. He fails his save. After much talk she ends up realizing that [[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]] is with us because [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] casted fireball to distract her which he did in [[Session 22]].

The inquisitor ended up taking Ubbe hostage and plans to kill him if he doesn't give good information. He ends up telling her the name of [[The Bishop]] and a lot of details about how to get to him.

[[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] decides that we need to pretend like we found out that the Inquisitor found out about [[The Bishop]] and such on their own and we found a report on it. We walk to [[Grayson]]'s dorm room and on the way [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] gives [[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]] a run down on everything we have don this year. He is told that he can not share any information with anyone outside of this group. Not even his mom.

We decide that we need to rest. [[Certiorari of De Novo|Legion]] has their little guy watch [[Grayson]]'s room as they rest. [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] and [[Ubbe Blackshield|Ubbe]] decide to go to [[Kermit's Girls]].

> "He doesn't want to give us his meat" [[Tasha Goldenwell|Tasha]] about [[Kermit]]

The mystery meatloaf meat was Nymph meat.

The party rest through the night and [[Grayson]] is not seen.
