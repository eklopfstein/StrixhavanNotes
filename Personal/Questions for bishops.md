The following questions are for a research paper on theoretical history related to gods. 
1. Has a god ever been overthrown before Endevorous (rumored or proven)?
2. What happened to Endevorous after he was overthrown? Does his being still exist somewhere?
3. Is there any knowledge that is kept to only high ranking members of the church? 
4. If so, what ranks have what access?
5. If several gods have been overthrown but survived over the years, could it be possible for them to work together and threaten the current world population (theoretically or factual)?
